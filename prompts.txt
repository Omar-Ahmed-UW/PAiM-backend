You must understand this all and deduce for the user what the main use cases are given their specified users, what the functionality of this system should be (what features are required on all parts of the stack of the system) like what the system requirements are including functional, quality, domain, business, and constraint requirements are involved in this system. Also this shouldn't just be an exercise where you list obvious things, but rather suggest features to the system beyond what the user specified.
